# Abstract

Academic performance relies, in part, on intelligence; however, intelligence quotient (IQ) is limited in predicting academic success. Furthermore, while the search for the biological seat of intelligence predates neuroscience itself, its findings remain conflicting. Here, we assess the interplay between IQ, academic performance, and brain connectivity with behavioral and functional MRI data collected from undergraduate students as they completed an active learning or lecture-based semester-long university physics course. IQ (i.e., full-scale WAIS scores) increased significantly pre-to post-instruction, were associated with physics knowledge and reasoning measures, but were unrelated to overall course grade. IQ was related to brain connectivity during physics-related cognition, but connectivity did not mediate IQ’s association with task performance. These relations depended on students’ sex and instructional environment, providing evidence that physics classroom environment and pedagogy may have a gendered influence on students’ performance. Discussion focuses on opportunities to improve physics reasoning skills for all students.
