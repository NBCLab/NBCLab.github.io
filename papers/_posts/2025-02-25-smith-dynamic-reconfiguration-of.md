# Abstract

Academic institutions are increasingly adopting active learning methods to enhance educational outcomes. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated neurobiological differences between active learning and traditional lecture-based approaches in university physics education. Undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory physics course underwent an fMRI session before and after a 15-week semester. Coactivation pattern (CAP) analysis was used to examine the temporal dynamics of brain states across different cognitive contexts, including physics conceptual reasoning, physics knowledge retrieval, and rest. CAP results identified seven distinct brain states, with contributions from frontoparietal, somatomotor, and visuospatial networks. Among active learning students, physics learning was associated with increased engagement of a somatomotor network, supporting an embodied cognition framework, while lecture-based students demonstrated stronger engagement of a visuospatial network, consistent with observational learning. These findings suggest significant neural restructuring over a semester of physics learning, with different instructional approaches preferentially modulating distinct patterns of brain dynamics.
