# Abstract

The increased availability of large-scale open-access resources on bioactivities of small molecules has a significant impact on pharmacology facilitated mainly by computational approaches that digest the vast amounts of data. We discuss here how computational data integration enables systemic views on a drug's action and allows to tackle complex problems such as the large-scale prediction of drug targets, drug repurposing, the molecular mechanisms, cellular responses or side effects. We particularly focus on computational methods that leverage various cell-based transcriptional, proteomic and phenotypic profiles of drug response in order to gain a systemic view of drug action at the molecular, cellular and whole-organism scale.
