# Abstract

The brain can be decomposed into large-scale functional networks, but the specific spatial topographies of these networks and the names used to describe them vary across studies. Such discordance has hampered interpretation and convergence of research findings across the field. We have developed the Network Correspondence Toolbox (NCT) to permit researchers to examine and report spatial correspondence between their novel neuroimaging results and multiple widely used functional brain atlases. We provide several exemplar demonstrations to illustrate how researchers can use the NCT to report their own findings. The NCT provides a convenient means for computing Dice coefficients with spin test permutations to determine the magnitude and statistical significance of correspondence among user-defined maps and existing atlas labels. The adoption of the NCT will make it easier for network neuroscience researchers to report their findings in a standardized manner, thus aiding reproducibility and facilitating comparisons between studies to produce interdisciplinary insights.
