# Abstract

BACKGROUND: Latino/a youth are at increased risk of electronic (e)-cigarette or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) use; thus, identifying factors impacting initiation is critical. Parenting practices reflecting warmth (e.g., relationship quality) and control (e.g., parental monitoring) and substance use-specific parenting (e.g., reactions to use, parenting self-efficacy) may influence youth substance use. For Latino/a youth, tensions from intergenerational acculturative differences are linked to substance use. We investigated ENDS use-specific parenting as a mediator between general parenting and youth ENDS use, examining whether acculturative gap conflict moderated the association between general and ENDS use-specific parenting. We expected mediation among families experiencing low acculturative gap conflicts. METHOD:  Data were analyzed over two waves from a predominantly White and Latino/a sample of caregiver-child dyads (N = 143) who identified with a culture in addition to or distinct from American. Youth (M(age) = 14.9 years, SD = 0.67; 62.9% female) reported relationship quality, parental monitoring, caregiver ENDS attitudes and reactions, acculturative gap conflicts, and ENDS use. Caregivers reported on ENDS use-specific parenting self-efficacy. Two moderated multiple mediator regression models (i.e., relationship quality, parental monitoring) were estimated. RESULTS:  Among youth reporting low and mean levels of acculturative gap conflict, ENDS use-specific parenting self-efficacy mediated the association between relationship quality and reduced ENDS use. There was no evidence for an interaction in the parental monitoring model. CONCLUSIONS:  In families experiencing low levels of acculturative gap conflict, relationship quality may impact ENDS use through caregivers' confidence in their ability to prevent child ENDS use.
