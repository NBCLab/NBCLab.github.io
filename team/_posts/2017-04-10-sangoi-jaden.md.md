Jaden is a graduate student in the Clinical Science in Child and Adolescent Psychology program at Florida International University, matriculated in 2022. He graduated with a B.S. in Behavioral Neuroscience from the University of Kansas in 2020, and graduated with an M.S. in Clinical Child Psychology from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 2022. Jaden is interested in examining the heterogeneity of neurodevelopment disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to better inform assessment and treatment strategies. Jaden's current research projects include 1) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to validate temperament-based groups of youth with ADHD, and 2) using mixed-methods research to identify long-term (i.e., career, family, relationship) goals of young adults with ASD.
