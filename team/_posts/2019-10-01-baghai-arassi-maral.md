Maral Baghai Arassi, MD, joined the group as a clinician scientist in October 2019. A graduate of the University of Freiburg Faculty of Medicine, she completed her paediatric residency in November 2023 and is currently a fellow in paediatric nephrology at the University Children’s Hospital in Heidelberg.

She focuses on the interactions between immunosuppressive drugs and gut bacteria, aiming to personalise immunosuppressive therapy to reduce post-transplant complications.
