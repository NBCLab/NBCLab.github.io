Selin joined the Zeller group as a PhD student in May 2022. She graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Molecular Biology Genetics from Inonu University, Turkey. Subsequently, she pursued a Master's degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Birmingham. Her Master's thesis focused on analysing the effects of oncogenic papillomavirus on host cell metabolism. This research experience sparked Selin's interest in the human microbiome and metabolome.

Selin focuses on identifying microbial signatures linked to early-onset colorectal cancer through the application of machine learning methods. Additionally, she explores the impact of gut microbiota on treatment outcomes in the context of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).
