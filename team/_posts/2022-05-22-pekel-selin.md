Selin graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Molecular Biology Genetics from Inonu University, Turkey. Following her undergraduate studies, she pursued a Master's degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Birmingham and her master thesis centered on dissecting the impact of oncogenic papillomavirus on host cell metabolism. Subsequently, she developed an interest in microbiome research and joined the Zeller group as a PhD student in May 2022.

Selin focuses on identifying microbial signatures linked to early-onset colorectal cancer through the application of machine learning models. Additionally, she explores the impact of gut microbiota on the outcomes of biological treatments in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).
