Fabian joined the group as a PhD student in May 2021 at EMBL Heidelberg. He obtained his Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry from the University of TÃ¼bingen and his Master's in Systems Biology from Heidelberg University, specialising in Multi-Omics analysis.

In his current PhD research, Fabian is exploring tumour tissue microbiomes, broadening the scope beyond colorectal cancer to encompass various other cancer types. He focuses on studying microbiomes in low-biomass tissue samples and establishing connections between microbial composition and molecular tumour characteristics. This research aims at deciphering the complex interactions between host cells and tissue-resident microbes, potentially illuminating new facets of cancer biology.

Fabian's research interests are diverse, spanning the methodological and computational challenges of studying microbiomes in cancer contexts, with an emphasis on enhancing our understanding of tumour biology.
