Fabian joined the group as a PhD student in 2021 at EMBL Heidelberg. He obtained his Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry from the University of TÃ¼bingen and then completed a Master's in Systems Biology at Heidelberg University, specializing in Multi-Omics analysis.

In his current PhD research, Fabian is exploring tumor tissue microbiomes, broadening the scope beyond colorectal cancer to encompass various other cancer types. His work focuses on understanding microbiomes in low-biomass tissues and establishing connections between microbial composition and molecular tumor characteristics. This research is aimed at deciphering the complex interactions between host cells and their microbiomes, potentially illuminating new facets of cancer biology.

Fabian's research interests are diverse, spanning the methodological and computational challenges of studying microbiomes in cancer contexts, with a consistent emphasis on enhancing our understanding of tumor biology.
