Iphigénie Gonnet joined the Zeller lab as a Ph.D. student in November 2023. She obtained her Master's degree in Bioinformatics from the Université Paris Cité. Driven by a curiosity cultivated during her academic journey, she diversified her interests from a first research experience in phylogeny to cancer cell signalling, which ultimately led to her Master's thesis on plant genomics and their adaptation to the environment.
Iphigénie is now passionate about advancing our understanding of the gut microbiome with the Zeller lab. As she begins her Ph.D. journey, she brings a foundational knowledge in omics data analysis and a keen interest in systems biology. Currently, Iphigénie is embarking on a project on delineating gut dysbiosis as well as healthy gut microbiome states. Comparing microbiome-disease signatures across many conditions, the goal of this project is to obtain a more quantitative model of the diseased and healthy gut.
