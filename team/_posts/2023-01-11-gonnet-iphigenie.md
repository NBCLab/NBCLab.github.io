Iphigénie Gonnet is a Ph.D. student at the Zeller lab. She earned her Master's degree in Bioinformatics from the Université Paris Cité. Driven by a curiosity cultivated during her academic journey, she diversified her interests from a first research experience in phylogeny to cancer cells signaling, which ultimately led to her master's thesis on plant genomics and their adaptation to the environment.

Iphigénie is now passionate about advancing our understanding of the gut microbiome with the Zeller lab. As she begins her Ph.D. journey, she brings a foundational knowledge in omics data analysis and a keen interest in systems biology. Currently, Iphigénie is embarking on a project classifying gut dysbiosis in an effort to better define the healthy gut microbiome. Using machine learning to identify diseases associated with gut microbiome signatures, the goal of this project is to integrate the vast body of gut metagenomic data available into predictive models of the diseased and healthy gut.
