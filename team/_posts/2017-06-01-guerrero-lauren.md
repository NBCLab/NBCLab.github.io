I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Previously, I worked as a behavioral therapist where my primary focus was helping children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This experience led me to assist the NBC lab in researching resting-state functional connectivity alterations in people diagnosed with ASD. My interests are focused on exploring the intersection of Neuroscience, Neuroimaging, and Computer Science.
