I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics at the University of Havana, Cuba. During that period, I worked in some interdisciplinary laboratories as a research assistant in the School of Physics and the Cuban Neuroscience Center (CNEURO).

I have a mathematical and physics background. I have skill with some statistical/neuroimaging software (Freesurfer, ANTs, AFNI, FSL, CONN, Wolfram Mathematica, Matlab), and some programming languages, such as C++, Python, HTML, CSS, FSL.

I am interested in Computational Neuroscience, Neuroimaging, Network Science, Meta-analysis, Computer Science, and Machine Learning.
