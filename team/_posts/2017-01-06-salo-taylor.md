I am a third-year graduate student in the Department of Psychology at Florida International University, specializing in Cognitive Neuroscience. I graduated from Cornell University (Ithaca, New York) with a B.A. in Psychology, before spending two years as a research assistant at the Translational Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience lab at University of California, Davis. I am mostly interested in neuroimaging meta-analysis and functional decoding, neuroinformatics tool development, data management for large neuroimaging datasets, and improving transparency and reproducibility in cognitive neuroscience.
