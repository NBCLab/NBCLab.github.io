Nicolai Karcher is a postDoc in the Zeller lab since the spring of 2021. His current research interests are disease signatures of the human gut microbiome (with a particular interest in colorectal cancer), how microbial metabolism of drugs is connected to solid organ transplantation outcomes as well as image analysis of intra-tumoral microbial FISH data. Before that, he did his PhD with Nicola Segata in Trento where he used shotgun metagenomics data to study strain-level variation and strain transmission characteristics of human gut bacteria.
