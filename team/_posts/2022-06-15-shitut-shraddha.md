Shraddha, a postdoctoral researcher, joined the group in July 2022. She holds a BSc in Microbiology from Abasaheb Garware College, Pune, India (2009) and an MSc in Microbiology from Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda, India (2011). She conducted research on cell length variability in E. coli at the Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research in Pune, India, before pursuing a PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Biology in Jena, Germany, under the guidance of Prof. Christian Kost, graduating in December 2017. During her PhD she focussed on the mechanism of metabolite exchange in bacteria and its effect on biosynthesis. She then started a postdoc project in Leiden, Netherlands in March 2018, focusing on the evolution of complexity in primordial cells using cell wall-deficient forms of Streptomyces. Throughout her research, she has developed expertise in various microscopy techniques.

Shraddha is currently involved in developing a FISH-based assay for understanding the spatial distribution of bacteria on tumor tissue. The idea here is to use sequential hybridization to identify up to 16 members using probes that target 16S rRNA. She is optimizing the sample treatment depending on tissue types (fresh frozen, FFPE, in vitro communities) and biology (colorectal cancer, liver cancer, gut community biofilms) to expand the potential applications of this method. She works closely with Nic Karcher who is developing the image analysis pipeline to automate the decoding process. She is more broadly interested in interactions between bacterial members in the tumor microenvironment.
