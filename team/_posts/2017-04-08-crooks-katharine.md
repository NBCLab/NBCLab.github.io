Katharine is a first-year graduate student in the Department of Psychology at Florida International University, specializing in Cognitive Neuroscience. She completed an M.S. in Psychology with a concentration in Behavioral Neuroscience from University of Houston - Clear Lake (Houston, TX) and a B.S. in Neuroscience with a concentration in Cognitive/Computation Neuroscience from The Ohio State University (Columbus, OH). Katharine is interested in the interaction between neuropsychiatric conditions and substance use, and their effect on brain processing. She is currently working on the Antecedents and Consequences of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ACE) Project, which examines the risk and protective factors leading to electronic nicotine systems (ENDS) usage among teenagers, alongside the impact of ENDS usage on the developing brain.
