Patrick is a PhD student in the Zeller group since February 2024 and previously did an intership in the same group (October 2023 - January 2024). He obtained a BSc in Biochemistry from Eberhard Karls University (Tübingen, Germany) in 2019 and an MSc in Bioinformatics at the same institute in 2023.

His research is focused on taxonomic profiling, particularly concerning bacteria and eukaryota within low-biomass samples. He seeks to integrate the microbial pangenome with community profiling approaches, specifically enhancing the mOTUs profiler developed within this group, to provide better resolution of microbial communities across diverse environments.
