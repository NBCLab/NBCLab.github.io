Dr. Sutherland’s research focuses on understanding the impact of drug abuse on human brain function. With emphasis on cigarette smoking, cannabis use, and HIV infection his research employs multiple neuroimaging tools (e.g., pharmacological, task-based and “resting-state” functional magnetic resonance imaging). Dr. Sutherland has a broad background in cognitive neuroscience and specific training in drug abuse. He earned his B.A. in Psychology from Ohio University (2002) and his Ph.D. in Psychology/Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of New Mexico (2007). He earned an Intramural Research Training Award to conduct postdoctoral research involving a cognitive neuroscience perspective on drug abuse in the Neuroimaging Research Branch at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA/NIH). He is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at FIU. Dr. Sutherland was recognized as a “Top Scholar” by FIU in 2015 and his research is currently funded by NIDA.
