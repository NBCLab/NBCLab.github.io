Dr. Tobia is a senior research scientist at the Center for Imaging Sciences at FIU.  His research utilizes computational modeling and multivariate analyses of multimodal brain imaging data, including fMRI and DTI, to interrogate brain structure and function.  His current research interests are concerned with functional connectivity of large-scale brain networks, the relationships among time-varying characteristics of brain signals and cognition in mental health, and multivariate methods for multimodal data fusion.
