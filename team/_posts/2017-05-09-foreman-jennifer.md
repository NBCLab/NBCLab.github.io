Jennifer is a Research Assistant with FIU’s NBC Lab and Center for Imaging Sciences. She earned an M.Sc. in Neuroimaging from King’s College London (UK), and a B.Sc. in Psychology from the University of North Florida. Her M.Sc. thesis used fMRI to explore the neurobehavioral impact of prolonged microgravity on the brain, specifically sensorimotor function, to provide therapies and countermeasures for astronauts during future long-duration space exploration missions and is part of a larger ongoing longitudinal study funded by NASA/NSBRI. She is currently assisting with the NIH-funded Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study and additional neuroimaging research projects and plans to pursue her Ph.D.
