Martin studied Molecular Biology and Computer Science at the Ecole Normale Supérieure
Paris-Saclay before pursuing a Master's degree in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics
at the Université Paris-Saclay. He joined the Zeller lab in 2019 to study
the secondary metabolism of the human gut microbiome.

Martin is involved in functional annotation, more specifically in the discovery 
of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). He spent most of his PhD developing GECCO, 
the Zeller lab project to identify novel BGCs *in silico* from genomic and 
metagenomic sequences.

In addition, he develops high-performance software for efficient analysis of
biological data, contributing interfaces for popular bioinformatics tools such
as Prodigal, HMMER, or developing new accelerated implementations of popular
algorithms.
