Raymund started his PhD with the Zeller group in November 2023. He studied molecular biology and organic chemistry, earning an MSc. Degree in Life Science, at the University of Konstanz in Germany between 2016-2022 followed by an Internship at the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, England. During this time he worked on protein-small molecule interactions and structural patterns of enzyme catalysis.  
Vast sequencing efforts in the past years have shown us just how little is currently known about the genes carried within the diverse gut ecosystem. Interactions both among microbes and with human cells are often mediated through many different chemical compounds with fascinating biological properties. Many of which are produced by intricate networks of enzymes working together in so-called biosynthetic gene clusters. For his PhD Raymund will computationally explore the functional universe of microbial enzymes in the human gut. With the hope of tapping into this ocean of biosynthetic potential, Raymund will leverage both classic computational tools and machine learning to find distant similarities to known enzymes but will also explore the genomic context to see how enzymes integrate into metabolic pathways to produce novel secondary metabolites. Developing and integrating tools for interring enzyme function may also shed light on how some microbes contribute to or even cause diseases in humans through their metabolic profile.
