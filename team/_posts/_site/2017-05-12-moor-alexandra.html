<p>I am a research assistant at ABCD that aids in the collection of fMRI imaging. I help train children for the activities that they will be doing in our long term study and inform them on what to expect when taking an MRI. My main goal in this field is to become a principle investigator, to help define, predict, and prevent certain neurological disorders, from Alzheimerâ€™s Disease to more prevalent disorders like Anxiety. I believe the key to eradicating these ailments is through preventative measures, by studying children I believe we can find ways to lower the rate of those occurrences early on so that future generations can have better quality of life with longer life spans.</p>
