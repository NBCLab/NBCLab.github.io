<p>I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics at the University of Havana, Cuba. During that period, I worked in some interdisciplinary laboratories as a research assistant in the School of Physics and in the Cuban Neuroscience Center (CNEURO). I was Co-leader in two projects. I presented in numerous Scientific Conference being awarded in some of them.</p>

<p>I have a strong mathematical background. I finished with outstanding grades in subjects like Analytical Geometry, Algebra (linear, tensors and group theory), Mathematical Analysis, Differential Equation, Mathematical Methods, Numerical Methods. I have skill with some statistical/neuroimaging software, and some programming languages, such as C++, Python, Wolfram Mathematica, Matlab, HTML, CSS, FSL.</p>

<p>I am interested in Computational Neuroscience, Neuroimaging, Network Science, Meta-analysis, Computer Science and Machine Learning.</p>
