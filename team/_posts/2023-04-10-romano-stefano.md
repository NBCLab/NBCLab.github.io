Stefano has been a postdoctoral researcher in the group since April 2023 and was previously a visiting postdoc (November 2021 - January 2022). He completed a PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen (Germany) and has worked as a postdoctoral research scientist in various institutes across Europe.

Currently, Stefano is conducting large-scale microbiome (meta)analyses, focusing on identifying bacterial taxa and functions associated with conditions such as Parkinson's disease and colorectal cancer. In general, Stefano is interested in understanding how the human gut microbiome influences ageing, age-related diseases, and neurodegeneration.
