Lauren is a third-year graduate student in the Department of Psychology at Florida International University, specializing in Cognitive Neuroscience. She completed her M.S. in Experimental Psychology from Nova Southeastern University (Fort Lauderdale, FL) and a B.S. in Psychology from Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO). Lauren is interested in the integration of multiple modalities (e.g. genotyping, EEG, fMRI) to better understand the brain mechanisms that underlie drug use. She is currently working on the NIH-funded Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, which will follow the biological and behavioral development of 10,000 children across the USA through adolescence.
