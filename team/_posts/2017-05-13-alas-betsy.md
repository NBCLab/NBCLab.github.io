Betsy Alas is a Post-Bac research assistant for the Antecedents and Consequences of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ACE) Project. She graduated from Florida International University with a B.A. in Psychology. Her interests in cognitive and biological fields led her to acquire research experience as an undergraduate research assistant for the ACE Project at FIU to conduct behavioral and neuroimaging assessments, which she has since been promoted to a staff member on the project. With the overall clinical experience she has obtained through numerous volunteering opportunities in the medical field, Betsy hopes to apply the insight she has attained in minority health disparities research when she pursues her goal of attending medical school.
