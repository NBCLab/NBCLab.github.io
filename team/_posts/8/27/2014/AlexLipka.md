Alexander E. Lipka is an Affiliate Professor of Biometry in the Department of Crop Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He currently teaches CPSC 440: Applied Statistics.

My research goals are to use my background in statistical genetics in an interdisciplinary environment to help answer questions pertaining (but not limited) to crop improvement. In particular, I am interested in the statistical approaches used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection(GS). In addition to collaborating with scientists and breeders, I would like to develop and apply novel statistical approaches to analyze genomic data.
