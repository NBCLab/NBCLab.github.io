In my time at FIU, I was a graduate student in the Department of Psychology at Florida International University, specializing in Cognitive Neuroscience, with Dr. Angela Laird as my advisor.
After graduating in 2022, I started as a post-doc on the informatics team in Ted Satterthwaite's [Lifespan Informatics and Neuroimaging Center](https://www.pennlinc.io) at the University of Pennsylvania.

I graduated from Cornell University (Ithaca, New York) with a B.A. in Psychology, before spending two years as a research assistant at the Translational Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience lab at the University of California, Davis.
I'm primarily interested in neuroinformatics (tool-building for cognitive neuroscience), reproducible neuroimaging research, and advanced fMRI denoising.

I am the project maintainer for [NiMARE](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE), a Python package for neuroimaging meta-analyses, and a core contributor to [tedana](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana), a library for denoising multi-echo fMRI data.
I also contribute to a number of neuroimaging-related Python tools, like [fMRIPrep](https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep), the [physiopy suite](https://github.com/physiopy), and [heudiconv](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv).

If you'd like to get in touch with me, feel free to email me or message me on the [BrainHack Mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/).
