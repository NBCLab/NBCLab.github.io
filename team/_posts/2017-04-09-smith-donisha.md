Currently, I am a second-year Cognitive Neuroscience graduate student at Florida International University, where I also obtained my B.S. in Biology. My current research interests includes using dynamic functional connectivity techniques to better identify subpopulations in highly heterogeneous neuropsychiatric populations and the use of computational cognitive neuroscience to simulate cognitive phenomena and neurocognitive disease/disorder processes.
