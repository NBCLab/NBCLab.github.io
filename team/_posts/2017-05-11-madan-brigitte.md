Brigitte Madan is a Post-Bac Research Assistant for the Antecedents and Consequences of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems Use (ACE) Project. She received her Bachelor’s in Psychology from the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill and her Associates in Psychology from the Honors College at Miami Dade College (MDC).

Brigitte previously worked at the Center for Health Equity Research at UNC as the PYD Lead designing positive youth development programs for high school students for Nash and Edgecombe Counties in rural North Carolina in Partnership with the University of Chicago’s MAPSCorp Program. In addition, Brigitte interned at the Simmons House Adolescent Unit in London, England. While there she worked with adolescents with mental health disorders. Brigitte also received experience in data collection and analysis during her time in London. While at MDC, she founded a series of workshops called Beauty for Ashes Seminars (BFA) to help young women and men redefine beauty. Her workshops explored the multiple influences that impact body image and self-esteem, including perspective, media, gender, and culture.

Brigitte’s research interests lay in adolescent decision-making, mood disorders, and cultural influences. She hopes to continue her education and obtain her Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology.
