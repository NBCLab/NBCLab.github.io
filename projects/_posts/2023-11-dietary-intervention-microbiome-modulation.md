The plastic nature of the gut microbiome facilitates its modulation through non-invasive methods, which makes it an attractive intervention target. Given that we, and others, have identified disease-associated signatures, it would in principle be possible to restore this disease-associated signature back into a healthy state. 
Given that diet is crucial in determining microbiome composition and function, we seek to understand the degree to which diet can impact the microbiome and host health and to what extent an effect on the host is mediated through the gut microbiome. To this end, we 1) analyze microbiome and other -omics data in collaborative settings with clinical partners and 2) perform meta-analyses on dietary intervention studies. The ultimate aim would be to understand how dietary interventions can be used to modulate the microbiome such that we can rationally design dietary interventions that restore ‘disease-associated microbiome states’ back into ‘healthy’ states.
