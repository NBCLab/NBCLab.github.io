DIVA was a pilot study in which we planned to acquire a large amount of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, demographic, and physiological data for a small sample of ~3 participants.
Unfortunately, data collection for DIVA was stopped early, due to the COVID19 pandemic.

DIVA was the brainchild of two lab graduate students, [Katherine Bottenhorn](/team/bottenhorn-katherine) and [Taylor Salo](/team/salo-taylor).
As such, it combines two research interests: Katie's interest in the impact of hormones on neurological and behavioral dynamics, and Taylor's interest in advanced fMRI denoising methods.
