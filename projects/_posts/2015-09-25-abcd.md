Florida International University is one of 21 institutions nationwide that will recruit families to participate in the ABCD Study. The Center for Children and Families’ (CCF) state-of-the-art physical facilities and resources serves as the ABCD project site for MRI and behavioral visits. Located on FIU’s Modesto A. Maidique campus, the CCF is a research, clinical, and training facility with 36 faculty affiliates. It has facilities in three buildings in the Academic Health Center (AHC) complex, as well as in the building that houses FIU’s psychology department. All of these buildings are within a 3-5 minute walk from each other. For more information about the ABCD study, please visit the [study website](https://abcdstudy.org/index.html).
