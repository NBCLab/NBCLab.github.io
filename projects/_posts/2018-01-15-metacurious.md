Bringing together human cleverness and big data, metaCurious is a tool to help you curate and annotate version-controlled collections of neuroimaging articles for meta-analyses. This tool facilitates collaboration and reproducibility by building sharable collections as GitHub repositories, providing a front end to [Brainspell-neo](https://brainspell.herokuapp.com), which started from Roberto Toro's Brainspell, itself based on Tal Yarkoni's [NeuroSynth](http://neurosynth.org): standing on the shoulders of Giants!

MetaCurious is developed in conjunction with a number of external collaborators, including the project leader, [Anisha Keshavan](https://github.com/akeshavan), as well as [JB Poline](https://github.com/jbpoline), [Greg Kiar](https://github.com/gkiar), and [Elizabeth DuPre](https://github.com/emdupre). The primary developer within the lab for metaCurious is [Katie Bottenhorn](/team/bottenhorn-katherine).
