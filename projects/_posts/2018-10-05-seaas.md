SEAAS (Social and Emotional Aspects of Academic Success) is a pilot project supported by [FIU Embrace](http://fiuembrace.fiu.edu/home/). The SEAAS Project is a collaboration between the NBC Lab, the [ABC-ERICA Lab](http://emusse2.wixsite.com/abc-erica-lab), and [Dr. Shanna Burke](https://stempel.fiu.edu/faculty/burke-shanna-l/). SEAAS is developing a robust psychiatric, behavioral, psychophysiological, and neuroimaging protocol to investigate social processing in individuals with high functioning autism spectrum disorder. Our goal is to study the social and emotional factors that impact academic performance and success in college age students.
