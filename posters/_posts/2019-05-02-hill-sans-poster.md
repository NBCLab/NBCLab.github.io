# Abstract

Chronic nicotine use perturbs multiple neurobiological systems involved with, for example, reward processing, emotion regulation, and cognitive control.
Resting-state fMRI studies have revealed that extended nicotine use can be characterized by important differences in neural activity for both local (i.e. regional) and remote scales.
Neuronal synchrony facilitates coordination and organization of information processing in the brain, where changes in local activity profiles may affect remote integration.
