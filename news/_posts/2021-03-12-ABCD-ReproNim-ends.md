The [ABCD-ReproNim Course](https://www.abcd-repronim.org), a virtual course providing training on reproducible analysis of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study dataset, has completed its final session, a week-long period of group projects, on March 12.
The 13-week long free online course hosted 22 [ABCD](https://abcdstudy.org) and [ReproNim](https://www.repronim.org) lecturers and offered instruction to 100 Enrolled students and more than 600 Observer students.
The concluding Project Week focused on student-led projects that examined various aspects of the ABCD dataset.
While the first offering of the course has come to a close, the [ABCD-ReproNim Course](https://www.abcd-repronim.org) will be offered again with dates to be announced!
