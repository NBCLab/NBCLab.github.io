[Lauren Hill-Bowen](/team/hill-lauren) and [Ranjita Poudel](/team/poudel-ranjita) were awarded $5,000 in pilot seed funding for their project titled, "Altered reward processing and chronic nicotine use: Training, preprocessing, and analysis of an existing simultaneous EEG-fMRI dataset". This project will leverage an existing electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset to provide enhanced understanding of the brain processes linked with chronic nicotine exposure and acute therapeutic administration. 

[Jessica Flannery](/team/flannery-jessica) was awarded $5,000 in pilot seed funding for her project titled, "Behavioral approach toward electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) stimuli and future use intentions among middle schoolers." This project will supplement data collection efforts of The ACE Project, an ongoing, large-scale, longitudinal study by developing a new behavioral task to assess adolescents' attitudes toward ENDS-related stimuli. 

Pilot project seed funding was provided by FIU's Center for Children and Families.
